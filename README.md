## Summary 
For this project we created a tool that helps you plan your next trip. Do you have a break
coming up, with no idea where to go? Visit our web app, enter your favorite three city
destinations, your favorite two restaurants in your current city (New York) and our app will
recommend a new city for you to visit, three restaurants in that city, and a list of
activities/attractions we think you would enjoy in that city.


## Data Sources
* Names of the cities and their corresponding countries. https://www.listchallenges.com/print-list/41692
* London Cities database which was scraped from
https://data.london.gov.uk/download/global-city-data/ffcefcba-829c-4220-911f-
d4bf17ef75d6/global-city-indicators.xlsx and returned cities along with their features.
* New York Cities database which was scraped from
http://www.worldcitiescultureforum.com/data and returned cities along with their
features.
* Trip advisor scraping where we first got a list of links corresponding to each cityâ€™s page
on Tripadvisor, then iteratively scraped each link for the features of each city returning
each feature and its corresponding numerical value.
* Using Yelp API: The rating and categories of each restaurant were retrieved from the yelp API and binary variables were used to determine whether a restaurant belonged to a category. The top 3 reviews of each restaurant (since this is all the yelp API allows) were compiled
into one text document and a sentiment analysis was run. Each emotion was used as an
attribute in the table.

## Model Development
### A. Which City should you visit next?
Given these datasets and the inputs by the user (3 cities, 2 restaurants):
ML Cities: We run an unsupervised machine learning algorithm on the Cities Dataset to find a
city recommendation, a city most similar to the three cities entered by the user, in terms of
their features. This is done using the unsupervised nearest neighbors machine learning
algorithm. To do this, we first scaled the data using StandardScaler. Then the data was fit to a
nearest neighbor model using the 3 input cities to find the distances between each of these
cities and the rest. These distances were summed over the three input cities and then the
dataset was reordered according the the closest distance. The top result, not including the
input cities, was chosen as the recommended city.

### B. Which restaurants should you try out within the recommended city?
ML Restaurants: We run a similar unsupervised machine learning algorithm on the Restaurants
Dataset to find a three restaurants in the recommended city, those that are most similar to the
two restaurants entered by the user, in terms of their categories and reviews sentiments. This is
done by first using the Yelp API to search for the attributes of the entered cities in New York.
Then, using the same method as the cities ML and filtering on the restaurants in the city that
had been recommended, we chose the top 3 results.

### C. Which activities should you gon within the recommended city?
Another function uses the three city entries and the Cities dataset to find the three most common features among the entered cities. This is done by summing the values of the features of these three cities and selecting the top three features. If these features apply to the recommended city, the function then finds the links to the pages where each of the features was found and grabs the top three headlines from each page and returns them as the recommended activities with links to them on tripadvisor.

## Model Deployment 
 For the web app, we used a Django Framework. To do this, we designed the HTML pages, designed the database models and added the application logic. We then deployed the app.
